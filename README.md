# Batch-File-Sorter
This is a batch script that sorts files in a directory by file type and moves them to corresponding subdirectories. The script prompts the user to select the folder to sort, enter a name for the subdirectory where the sorted files will be stored, and then loops through each file in the directory. For each file, the script gets the file extension and checks if a subdirectory with that name already exists. If it does not exist, the script creates a new subdirectory for that file type and then moves the file to that subdirectory. Finally, the script outputs a message stating which file was moved to which directory and indicates that the sorting process is complete.

## Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Download and launch the [sort.bat](https://github.com/ALIILAPRO/Batch-File-Sorter/blob/main/sort.bat)
2. When prompted, enter the path of the folder you want to sort.
3. When prompted, enter a name for the subdirectory where the sorted files will be stored.
